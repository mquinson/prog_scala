# SBT

See the [official documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/documentation.html) for details.

Once `sbt` is [installed](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/tutorial/Setup.html), copy `build.sbt` and the `src` directory to your project folder.

You can then launch the app with `sbt run`.

The first launch will download the Scala library and Scala Swing (be patient).
