* Introduction
In this project, you will implement a [[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tower_defense][Tower Defense]] called Ants
Vs. SomeBees.  As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the
bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from
the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by
throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester
the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the
bees' wrath. 

This project is highly inspired by an [[http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/denero-ants-vs-somebees/ants.html][existing assignment]] from John
DeNero, Tom Magrino and Eric Tzeng (UC Berkeley), which was inspirated
by the PopCap Games' [[http://www.popcap.com/games/pvz/web][Plants Vs. Zombie]] ®. The current version was
adapted from the Python programming language to Scala by myself. It it
provides you with less pre-written code, but gives you much more
freedom about how to organize your code. Freedom may be disturbing, at
first, but you'll get used to it ;)

** Core Concepts
A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each
turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are
placed. Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual
actions: bees sting ants, and ants throw leaves at bees. The game ends
either when a bee reaches the ant queen (you lose), or the entire bee
flotilla has been vanquished (you win).

*The Colony*. The colony consists of several places that are chained
together. The /exit/ of each /Place/ leads to another /Place/.

*Placing Ants*. There are two constraints that limit ant
production. Placing an ant uses up some amount of the colony's food, a
different amount for each type of ant. Also, only one ant can occupy
each /Place/.

*Bees*. When it is time to act, a bee either moves to the exit of its
current Place if no ant blocks its path, or stings an ant that blocks
its path.

*Ants*. Each type of ant takes a different action and requires a
different amount of food to place. The two most basic ant types are
the /HarvesterAnt/, which adds one food to the colony during each
turn, and the /ThrowerAnt/, which throws a leaf at a bee each turn.

** Due date and grading

You are requested form teams for two people for this project, with
(only) one group of three people. Nobody is allowed to work alone. You
have turn your code before Sunday December 6. at noon. The defenses
will be organized on Tuesday December 8. instead of the usual
practical. You will have to turn in your slides on that day. Finally,
you will have to send your report *and a 60-seconds long screencast* of
your application before Sunday December 13. No late submission will be
accepted. Kazam is a nice application to take screencasts.

* Technical setup

** scala-swing

This project must be written in Scala, using the Swing library. You
really should use the scala-swing library, which provides Scala
wrappers to the main Java Swing classes. You can download the
mandatory library from [[https://github.com/mquinson/prog_scala/tree/master/jars][this site]]. If you feel brave, you can try to
use ScalaFX, which will be a much better solution to build GUI in
Scala. But unfortunately, ScalaFX is still under construction.

** Editing with Eclipse
It is advised (although not mandatory) that you use the Eclipse source
editor for this assignment. That's a huge machinery, but it's really
worth learning. When you know it, this tool can greatly increase your
code productivity. Don't miss this [[http://scala-ide.org/download/current.html][introductive video]]. Its major
drawback however is its size. Eclipse is really the programming
caterpilar, and you have to have a good laptop with at least 4 Gb of
RAM to use it comfortably.

First, download the [[http://scala-ide.org/][Scala IDE]] and install it on your machine, or add
the its update site to your existing Eclipse installation.

Create a new project, and copy the [[https://github.com/mquinson/prog_scala/raw/master/jars/scala-swing_2.11-2.0.0-M2.jar][scala-swing.jar]] files into its main
directory. Open the project properties (from the right-click menu),
and select to the "Java Build Path" entry. In the "Libraries" tab, add
the scala-swing jarfile as a JAR. This should look as follows before
you click OK:

[[./img/scala-swing-jar.png]]

Once done, the [[./src/main/scala/FirstTest.scala][first provided code]] should open an empty window. To
test it, download this file, and copy it in the src/ folder of your
eclipse project. Then in eclipse, press F5 to see it appear in the
project explorer, right click on the file and select "Run As" / "Scala
application". Once you've done it one time, you can directly run the
program by clicking on the little button above the code green arrow.

[[./img/eclipse-run.png]]

** Compiling with ~sbt~

[[http://www.scala-sbt.org/][Simple Build Tool]] (sbt for short) is a very pleasant tool to compile
your Scala code. If you (or your computer) are alergic to Eclipse,
using sbt with any decent editor (such as [[http://www.geany.org/][Geany]]) is probably the best
solution. Simply edit in Geany and compile in a separate
terminal. That's the easiest: use an editor to edit and an builder to
build your code\ldots

Download ~sbt~ from its [[http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html][webpage]], unpack it somewhere (e.g. under
~/opt/sbt~) and add the ~bin~ directory to your PATH with the
following commands. This approach is better to the one [[http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html][described in
the official sbt documentation]] because it does not install anything
with the super-user privileges. You are asked for your root password,
but only to create a new directory. No installed file have the root
privilege: I never install stuff from untrusted source with the root
privilege.

#+LaTeX: \footnotesize\vspace{-.5\baselineskip}
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :export code
# Create the directory (needs root password)
sudo mkdir -p /opt/sbt
# Give the directory ownership to yourself
sudo chown -R `logname` /opt/sbt
# Enter that directory
cd /opt/sbt 
# Unpack the archive
tar xf ~/Téléchargements/sbt-0.13.9.tgz 
# Add the binary directory into your PATH
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/sbt/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
# Reload the shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc
# Launch your code.
sbt run
# This first run will download some dependencies
#+END_SRC
#+LaTeX: \normalsize

Please see the [[http://www.scala-sbt.org/documentation.html][sbt documentation]] for more information.

** Compiling manually
If everything else fails, you can always compile your code from the
command line as follows. You should however really try to get at least
~sbt~ working, because such manual compilations are really bothersome
on the long term.

#+LaTeX: \footnotesize\vspace{-.5\baselineskip}
#+begin_src shell :export code
scalac -cp scala-swing.jar:. FirstTest.scala
scala -cp scala-swing.jar:. FirstTest
#+end_src
#+LaTeX: \normalsize

For that, you need to copy the [[https://github.com/mquinson/prog_scala/raw/master/jars/scala-swing_2.11-2.0.0-M2.jar][scala-swing.jar]] file in your directory,
under that exact name.

When your code evolves, you need to replace ~FirstTest.scala~ on
the first line by the name of your source files. On the second line,
give the name of your main class instead of ~FirstTest~. 

** Code Versioning

As you will eventually realize, it is very difficult to share code
with your teammates without the appropriate tools. You are perfectly
free to use anything you see fit, such as USB key, email attachments
or pigeons, but you probably want to use a SVN or Git.

#+LaTeX: \newpage
* Warm up

You are provided with an initial application called [[https://github.com/mquinson/prog_scala/tree/master/Project_Ants/src/main/scala/DemoApp.scala][DemoApp]] It
exemplifies everything you need to know about the Scala Swing library.
Download it, and read its code. You see that the code falls in three
big parts: (1) a /state/ object that contains the whole game state,
(2) an /ui/ object: a graphical panel on which the game is drawn and
which listens to the keyboard and mouse events, (3) a /timer/ object
for the game animation, which calls /state.update/ and /ui.repaint/ 50
times per second. When the application starts, a window is created at
the very bottom of this file and populated with the /ui/.

** Introducing a class Insect

Modify the provided code to introduce a proper class named /Insect/
encapsulating all of the sprite logic.  It should encapsulate the
position and speed of a Sprite as well as the image displayed
image. It should provide the necessary methods to make the code of
your /state/ and /ui/ clean and pleasant to read.

** Introducing a class Place

A place is a location of the game, depicted as a cell on the board. It
is defined by its name and position (its constructor takes two
parameters). It can contain one or several bees and at most one
ant. Each place is connected to an entrance and an exit (the entrance
of its exit is itself). Define the corresponding class, and populate
your game with 8 places that form a tunnel.

* First game
We will first write the main game elements according to the following
screenshot.

[[./img/gui_explanation.png]]

The hive is on top. This is where you select the kind of ant that you
want to place on your board. The hive cell containing the word "Bye"
is particular: when you select this cell and click on one of your
existing ant, it is removed from the game.  Under the hive, you can
see one tunnel of height places, in which you can place ants. Later in
the game, we will create several tunnels forming several lines one
under another. On the right, you can see 2 bees that will soon enter
your tunnel.

\medskip 

** The basics

In this first game, food is not an issue: you can create as many ants
as you wish until you fill all existing Places. For that, click on the
one cell of the Hive to select it, and then click on the tunnel place
in which you want to add an ant of the selected type.

The game is decomposed in several turns (of three seconds each). The
player can add new ants at any time during the game.  At each turn,
the following actions occur:

- A bee enters in the right-most place of the tunnel, unless all bees
  entered the game already.
- Each ant moves, depending on its type.  The ~HarversterAnt~ adds one
  Food to the colony (useless for now, but soon crucial). If a bee is
  in the same Place, the ~ThrowerAnt~ removes one Armor to the bee. An
  insect with 0 Armor is killed.
- Each bee moves.
  - If there is no ant in its place, it moves to the next place.
  - If there is an ant in its place, it reduce its Armor by one.

If all bees are defeated, the player wins. If one bee passes the
left-most place, the player loses.

** Making a real game

Implement the food logic, where you cannot place a new ant if you
don't have enough food.

</div>
#+END_HTML

Now, modify your HaversterAnt so that it shots at the nearest bee on
its right. Well, it makes the game a bit too easy, so we will
introduce two new kind of ants. The short-range thrower can only shot
bees that are at most two entrances away while the long-range thrower
can only shot bees that are at least three entrances away.

** Graphical Refinements

The insects should move smoothly from one place to another at the end
of each turn, and the leaves shot by throwers should be animated
too. The player should still be able to place ants at any point of
time (provided that there is enough food).

* Water and Fire

** Adding a Fire Ant

Implement the /FireAnt/. A /FireAnt/ has a special /reduceArmor/
method: when the /FireAnt/'s armor reaches zero or lower, it will
reduce the armor of all /Bee/s in the same /Place/ as the FireAnt by
its damage attribute (defaults to 3).

#+BEGIN_HTML
<div align="center">
#+END_HTML
#+CAPTION: Fire Ant (Cost: 5; Armor: 1)
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width .2\linewidth
[[./src/main/resources/ant_fire.png]]
#+BEGIN_HTML
<b>Fire Ant</b> (Cost: 5; Armor: 1)
</div>
#+END_HTML

** Adding water to the game

Our tunnels are a bit boring as is, because all places are the same
(but the hive). To make things more interesting, we're going to create
a new type of Place called Water.

Only an ant that is /watersafe/ can be deployed to a /Water/ place. In
order to determine whether an Insect is /watersafe/, add a new
attribute to the Insect class named /watersafe/ that is /false/ by
default. Since bees can fly, make their watersafe attribute true,
overriding the default.

Now, implement the /addInsect/ method for /Water/. First call
/Place.addInsect/ to add the insect, regardless of whether it is
/watersafe/. Then, if the insect is not /watersafe/, reduce the
insect's armor to 0 by invoking /reduceArmor/. Do not copy and paste
code. Try to use methods that have already been defined and make use
of inheritance to reuse the functionality of the /Place/ class.

** Adding water to the board

Change the code that create the tunnel to now create 3 tunnels of 8
places each in which every third place is water. When a bee enters the
board, it picks a tunnel randomly.

You may also change your code so that bees arrive in waves at
pre-determined turns (to leave some time to the player to rebuild the base).

** Adding a Scuba ant

 Currently there are no ants that can be placed on Water. Implement
 the /ScubaThrower/, which is a subclass of /ThrowerAnt/ that is more
 costly and /watersafe/, but otherwise identical to its base class.

#+BEGIN_HTML
<div align="center">
#+END_HTML
#+CAPTION: Scuba Thrower (Cost: 5; Armor: 1)

[[./src/main/resources/ant_scuba.png]]
#+BEGIN_HTML
<b>Scuba Thrower</b> (Cost: 5; Armor: 1)
</div>
#+END_HTML

* More units
** Wall Ant
We are going to add some protection to our glorious /AntColony/ by
implementing the /WallAnt/, which is an ant that does nothing each turn
(already the default action of the /Ant/ class). A /WallAnt/ is useful
because it has a large armor value.

#+BEGIN_HTML
<div align="center">
#+END_HTML
#+CAPTION: Wall Ant (Cost: 4; Armor: 4)
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width .15\linewidth
[[./src/main/resources/ant_wall.png]]
#+BEGIN_HTML
<b>Wall Ant</b> (Cost: 4; Armor: 4)
</div>
#+END_HTML

** Ninja Ant
 Implement the /NinjaAnt/, which damages all Bees that pass by, but is
 never seen. It cannot be attacked by a /Bee/ because it is hidden,
 nor does it block the path of a /Bee/ that flies by. To implement
 this behavior, add a new attribute /blocksPath/ to /Ant/ that is
 /true/ by default and /false/ for /NinjaAnt/.

#+BEGIN_HTML
<div align="center">
#+END_HTML
#+CAPTION: Ninja Ant (Cost: 6; Armor: 1)
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width .2\linewidth
[[./src/main/resources/ant_ninja.png]]
#+BEGIN_HTML
<b>Ninja Ant</b> (Cost: 6; Armor: 1)
</div>
#+END_HTML

** HungryAnt
We will now implement the new offensive unit called the /HungryAnt/,
which will eat a random /Bee/ from its place, instantly killing the
Bee. After eating a Bee, it must spend 3 turns digesting before eating
again.

#+BEGIN_HTML
<div align="center">
#+END_HTML
#+CAPTION: Hungry Ant (Cost: 4; Armor: 1)
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width .2\linewidth
[[./src/main/resources/ant_hungry.png]]
#+BEGIN_HTML
<b>Hungry Ant</b> (Cost: 4; Armor: 1)
</div>
#+END_HTML

* God saves the Queen
** Bodyguard Ant
A /BodyguardAnt/ differs from a normal /Ant/ because it can occupy the
same /Place/ as another ant. When a /BodyguardAnt/ is added to the
same /Place/ as another ant, it shields the other ant and protects it
from damage. Attacks should damage the /BodyguardAnt/ first and only
hurt the protected ant after the /BodyguardAnt/ has perished.

A /BodyguardAnt/ has a field /ant/ that stores the ant contained
within the bodyguard. It should start off as /null/, indicating that
no ant is currently being protected. Give /BodyguardAnt/ a
/containAnt/ method that adds the Ant passed as a parameter inti that
field.

#+BEGIN_HTML
<div align="center">
#+END_HTML
#+CAPTION: Bodyguard (Cost: 4; Armor: 2)
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width .1\linewidth 
[[./src/main/resources/ant_weeds.png]]
#+BEGIN_HTML
<b>Bodyguard</b> (Cost: 4; Armor: 2)
</div>
#+END_HTML


Now, change your program so that a BodyguardAnt and another Ant can
simultaneously occupy the same Place: 

- Add an attribute to /Ant/ indicating whether it is a container. Only
  /BodyguardAnt/ are containers.
- Add a a method to /ant/ indicating whether the receiver can contain
  the parameter. It is so if and only if the receiver is an empty
  container and the paramter is not a container.
- Change the /addInsect/ method accordingly.
** QueenAnt

The queen is a waterproof /ScubaThrower/ that inspires her fellow ants
through her bravery. Whenever the queen throws a leaf, she also
doubles the damage of all other ants in the same tunnel with her,
including any ants protected by a bodyguard. Once any ant's damage has
doubled, it cannot be doubled again. 

#+BEGIN_HTML
<div align="center">
#+END_HTML
#+CAPTION: Queen ant (Cost: 6; Armor: 2)
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width .2\linewidth
[[./src/main/resources/ant_queen.png]]
#+BEGIN_HTML
<b>Queen ant</b> (Cost: 6; Armor: 2)
</div>
#+END_HTML

However, with great power comes great responsibility. The Queen is
governed by three special rules:

- If a bee ever enters the place occupied by the queen, then the bees
  immediately win the game. The game ends even if the queen is
  protected by a bodyguard. The bees also win if any bee reaches the
  end of a tunnel where the queen normally would reside.

- There can be only one true queen. Any queen beyond the first one is
  an impostor and should die immediately (its armor reduced to 0) upon
  taking its first action, without doubling any ant's damage or
  throwing anything

- The true (first) queen cannot be removed. Attempts to remove the
  queen should have no effect (but should not cause an error).


* Extensions

Feel free to implement any extensions that you may see fit. Some
gameplay elements may be interesting, such as new units or new
enemies. You can also change your game to a more classical tower
defense where the units can move freely over a given path and/or
provide ant updates that come at some price. But such work is more
centered on the game design. While interesting, this is not the topic
of this assignment. Please check [[http://people.irisa.fr/Martin.Quinson/Hacking/Curiosa/#game][that page]] for more pointers.

But it is much more interesting to experiment with Functional
Programming once your project is fully working in OOP. This topic is
covered in a short [[http://prog21.dadgum.com/23.html][set of blog posts]] discussing the programming of
purely functional retrogames, focused on a simple Pac-Man. This blog
is particularly interesting to programming learners. I am an absolute
fan of its subtitle: "It's not about technology for its own sake. It's
about being able to implement your ideas". Yeah! Exactly!

This [[https://michaelshaw.github.io/game_talk/game.htm][other presentation]] presents the organization of a rather large
game using the functional approach with Scala. This is probably larger
than what you will need for your project, but that's still very
interesting. 

Remember, you should finish your project following the OOP approach
before even thinking of the FP approach.
