# System Programming with Scala

This repository contains the teaching material that I use for my
lectures on System Programming at ENS Rennes.

If you are a student of ENS Rennes, you will not find any solution to
the exercises. You should not read the material before the lectures to
not spoil yourself, but it does not hurt if you do. After the lecture,
your help is welcome to improve the material. Pull requests welcome ;)

## Syllabus

- Lecture 1:
  [Introduction](https://github.com/mquinson/prog_scala/raw/master/Lecture1/scala_lect1.pdf).
  We first try to motivate the study of systems programming, and
  discuss the philosophy of Computer Science to show that Programming
  large Systems is absolutely central in Computer Science. After this
  (hopefully) motivating introduction, we present the basics of the
  Scala syntax.


## Compiling the lessons

Everything is written with org-mode, of emacs. If you are really new
to this, check the [little introduction](http://people.irisa.fr/Martin.Quinson/Research/Students/Methodo/)
that I wrote in another context.

If you want to run everything with a simple ```make```, you need to
also install [latex-make](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latex-make). That's
very easy if you use a Linux system, but I was told that it's also
possible with Mac OSX.
