# System Programming with Scala

This repository contains the teaching material that I use for my
lectures on System Programming at [ENS Rennes](http://ens-rennes.fr/). 
This is a undergrad lecture, introductionnary on scala (but not on
programming).

If you are a student of ENS Rennes, you will not find any solution to
the exercises. You should not read the material before the lectures to
not spoil yourself, but it does not hurt if you do. After the lecture,
your help is welcome to improve the material. Pull requests welcome ;)

## Syllabus

- *Lecture 1: [Introduction](https://github.com/mquinson/prog_scala/raw/master/Lecture1/scala_lect1.pdf).*

  We first try to motivate the study of systems programming, and
  discuss the philosophy of Computer Science to show that Programming
  large Systems is absolutely central in Computer Science. 
  
  After this (hopefully) motivating introduction, we present the
  basics of the Scala syntax.

- *Practical 1: [First steps with Scala on the PLM](https://plm.telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/#/ui/lessons/recursion.hanoi/).*

  We use the lesson on Hano√Ø Towers of [the PLM](https://github.com/BuggleInc/PLM) 
  to experiment with the Scala syntax.

- *Lecture 2: [Dealing with Complexity](https://github.com/mquinson/prog_scala/raw/master/Lecture2/scala_lect2.pdf).*

  Large systems are inherently complex and dynamic, so we want to
  design our systems in a way that mitigates these issues.
  
  We lengthly discuss the Object Oriented Programming approach(OOP),
  that is the classical reductionist solution to the system
  complexity. There is no absolute rule about how to build a Good
  Design (TM), but we present several rules of thumb to avoid horrible
  designs, at least.

  As a conclusion (and as an appertizer for next week's lecture) we
  then shortly contrast this OOP approach with the Functional
  Programming (FP) way of composing complex systems.

## Compiling the lessons

Everything is written with org-mode, of emacs. If you are really new
to this, check the [little introduction](http://people.irisa.fr/Martin.Quinson/Research/Students/Methodo/)
that I wrote in another context.

If you want to run everything with a simple ```make```, you need to
also install [latex-make](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latex-make). That's
very easy if you use a Linux system, but I was told that it's also
possible with Mac OSX.
