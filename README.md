Teaching material for my lecture /System Programming with Scala/ at
ENS Rennes.

If you are a student of ENS Rennes, you will not find any solution to
the exercises. You should not read the material before the lectures to
not spoil yourself, but it does not hurt if you do. After the lecture,
your help is welcome to improve the material. Pull requests welcome ;)
